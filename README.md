# Prized Projects created by Calla Rudolph

I started Epicodus in May of 2017 after 10 years in hotel operations. Having essentially no prior experience with coding, I was intimidated at first, but have been amazed with how quickly I was able to pick up PHP and JavaScript!

This is a summary of my favorite projects made during my time at Epicodus. Click on the repo name to view the project in GitHub, or click on the deployed/gh-pages link to see the app in action!
