# Prized Projects created by Calla Rudolph

I started Epicodus in May of 2017 after 10 years in hotel operations. Having essentially no prior experience with coding, I was intimidated at first (looking at you, command line), but have been amazed with how quickly I was able to pick up PHP and JavaScript!

This is a summary of my favorite projects made during my time at Epicodus, beginning late May 2017. Click on the repo name to view the project in GitHub, or click on the deployed/gh-pages link to see the app in action!

Technologies used include: PHP, ReactJS, JavaScript, Angular 2.0, Ember.js, HTML, CSS, Node.js, MySQL, Silex, PHPUnit, phpMyAdmin, Twig, jQuery, Git, API, Bootstrap, Sass, AJAX, and Firebase.

_All apps were created independently unless otherwise specified._
